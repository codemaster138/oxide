# This file contains yacc-like grammar definitions, but isn't actually used by the code
# I only use it to better wrap my head around how the parser grammars work.
# Syntax:
#                  [      group      ]
#                   [  group  ]
#                        | <- Union
# expr      : term ((PLUS|MINUS) term)* <- “*” matches 0 or more of previous group
# ^           ^      ^Token type ^
# Name        reference          reference


expr        : term  ((PLUS|MINUS) term)*
term        : power  ((MUL|DIV) power)*
power       : atom ((POW|NPOW) atom)*
atom        : (INT|FLOAT)
            : LPAREN expr RPAREN
